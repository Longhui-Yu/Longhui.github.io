# Kevin Keomanee-Dizon

I am a PhD student at the University of Southern California (USC) [Translational Imaging Center](http://bioimaging.usc.edu). I am advised by [Scott E. Fraser](http://bioimaging.usc.edu/sefraser.html), collaborate closely with [Thai V. Truong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thai_Truong), and am funded by the [Alfred E. Mann Doctoral Fellowship](http://ami.usc.edu/outreach/). I am broadly interested in optical and biological physics.

I received a BS from [Loyola Marymount University](http://lmu.edu/) in 2012, worked as a validation engineer at [Unbound Consulting](http://unbound-consulting.com/) from 2012-14, and earned a MS from [USC](http://usc.edu/) in 2015; I joined the USC Translational Imaging Center as a PhD student in 2016.

## Research

 I develop new optical tools with an eye toward understanding physical principles that govern biological function. Much of my work has focused on quantitative biological imaging and lately I've been building light-sheet and light-field microscopes to image biological phenomena at a wide range of scales, from the dynamics of individual bacterial cells to memory/learning in the brains of animals. In the past, I did research in single-molecule biophysics and super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.
