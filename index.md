# Kevin Keomanee-Dizon

I am a PhD student at the University of Southern California (USC) [Translational Imaging Center](http://bioimaging.usc.edu), working with [Scott E. Fraser](http://bioimaging.usc.edu/sefraser.html) and [Thai V. Truong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thai_Truong) at the interface between physics and biology.

I received a BS from [Loyola Marymount University](http://lmu.edu/) in 2012, worked as a validation engineer at [Unbound Consulting](http://unbound-consulting.com/) from 2012-14, and earned a MS from [USC](http://usc.edu/) in 2015. I joined the USC Translational Imaging Center as a PhD student in 2016 and am funded by the [Alfred E. Mann Doctoral Fellowship](http://ami.usc.edu/outreach/).

# News

* I attended the [International Summer School on Adaptive Optics](http://cfao.ucolick.org/aosummer/2018/index.html) at the UC Santa Cruz [Center for Adaptive Optics](http://cfao.ucolick.org/mission.php) (July-August 2018)

## Research

I develop new optical tools with an eye toward understanding physical principles that govern biological function. Much of my work has focused on quantitative  imaging and lately I've been building light-sheet and light-field microscopes to image biological phenomena at a wide range of scales, from the dynamics of individual bacterial cells to memory/learning in the brains of animals. In the past, I did research in single-molecule biophysics and super-resolution microscopy.
