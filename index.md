# Kevin Keomanee-Dizon

I'm a PhD student at the University of Southern California (USC) [Translational Imaging Center](http://bioimaging.usc.edu). I am advised by [Scott E. Fraser](http://bioimaging.usc.edu/sefraser.html), collaborate closely with [Thai V. Truong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thai_Truong), and am funded by the [Alfred E. Mann Doctoral Fellowship](http://ami.usc.edu/ami-fellowships/).

I received a BS from [Loyola Marymount University](http://lmu.edu/) in 2012, worked as a validation engineer at [Unbound Consulting](http://unbound-consulting.com/) from 2012-14, and earned a MS from [USC](http://usc.edu/) in 2015.

## Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in optical and biological physics. Much of my work has focused on quantitative bioimaging and lately I've been building light-sheet and light-field microscopes to image biological phenomena at a wide range of scales, from the dynamics of individual bacterial cells to memory/learning in the brain of animals. In the past, I did research in single-molecule biophysics and super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.
